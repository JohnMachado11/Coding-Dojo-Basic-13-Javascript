# Coding-Dojo-Basic-13-Javascript
The "Basic 13" Algorithms from Coding Dojo

**1. Get 1 to 255**:
  Write a function that returns an array with all the numbers from 1 to 255. You may use the push() function for this exercise.
  
**2. Get even 1000**:
  Write a function that would get the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 1000. You may use a modulus operator for this exercise.
  
**3. Sum odd 5000**:
  Write a function that returns the sum of all the odd numbers from 1 to 5000. (e.g. 1+3+5+...+4997+4999)
  
**4. Iterate an array**:
  Write a function that returns the sum of all the values within an array. (e.g. [1,2,5] returns 8, [-5,2,5,12] returns 14)
  
**5. Find max**:
  Given an array with multiple values, write a function that returns the maximum number in the array. (e.g. for [-3,3,5,7] max is 7)
  
**6. Find average**: 
  Given an array with multiple values, write a function that returns the average of the values in the array. (e.g. for [1,3,5,7,20] average is 7.2)
  
**7. Array odd**:
  Write a function that would return an array of all the odd numbers between 1 to 50. (ex. [1,3,5, .... , 47,49]). Hint: Use 'push' method.
  
**8. Greater than Y**:
  Given value of Y, write a function that takes an array and returns the number of values that are greater than Y. For example if arr = [1, 3, 5, 7] and Y = 3, your function will   return 2. (There are two values in the array greater than 3, which are 5, 7)
  
**9. Squares**:
  Given an array with multiple values, write a function that replaces each value in the array with the product of the original value multiplied by itself. (e.g. [1,5,10,-2] will     become [1,25,100,4])
  
**10. Negatives**: 
  Given an array with multiple values, write a function that replaces any negative numbers within the array with the value of 0. When the program is done the array should contain   no negative values. (e.g. [1,5,10,-2] will become [1,5,10,0])
  
**11. Max/Min/Avg**:
  Given an array with multiple values, write a function that returns a new array that only contains the maximum, minimum, and average values of the original array. (e.g.           [1,5,10,-2] will return [10,-2,3.5])
  
**12. Swap values**:
  Write a function that will swap the first and last values of any given array. The default minimum length of the array is 2. (e.g. [1,5,10,-2] will become [-2,5,10,1])
  
**13. Number to string**:
  Write a function that takes an array of numbers and replaces any negative values within the array with the string 'Dojo'. For example if array = [-1,-3,2], your function will   return ['Dojo','Dojo',2].
